# ROMA2032
A near-future cyberpunk setting based in an (even more) dysfunctional Italy. 

######IN ROMA2032...
Silvio Berlusconi is still alive, and still prime Minister, though he lives on life support and true power is held and real power is held by his circle of cronies.

IN ROMA2032...
Democracy is all but nominal, with all positions of import being appointed, and the periodic shifting of parties not unlike a grotesque gameshow; a politicised calcio tournament with little bearing on the governance of Italy.

IN ROMA2032...
Neon Farmacias dispense recreational drugs and anti-depressants to the population.

IN ROMA2032...
Real power in the inner cloisters of the Quirinale is contested by the Ndrangheta, Camorra, La Cosa Nosta, The Emancipated Northern Alliance, and The Vatican, (irrespective of the meaningless shiftings of Socialist and Nationalist coalitions).

IN ROMA2032...
The Northern Alliance of economic centers have emancipated themselves from Italy in all but name. Their secession is not official, nor is it recognised by the EU or Italy. However, in practise, the corporations behind the Northern Alliance have created an anarcho-capitalistic, compulsory consumerist zone. These prosperous and towering megapolises have boomed as centers of culture and economy, as much of Europe’s capital flocks to their tax-free havens. The super-rich live lives higher than anywhere else in the world. Echoing the Italian city-states of the Renaissance, these autonomous zones are dominated by a prosperous but invasive culture merciless plutocracy.

IN ROMA2032...
The government of te Republic of Italy is all but bankrupt, serving mainly as a semi-legitimate arena for money-laundering, profiteering, and legitimised extortion of the unaffiliated populace. The husk of constitutional governance is prevented from collapsing in upon itself despite being long defunct, so that it may be worn as a mantle of legitimacy in the eyes of the EU who whatsoever faction maintains dominance in the Quirinale.
 
IN ROMA2032...
The centro of Rome is a hotly contested political theatre of conflict, with factions from all over Italy vying for control. The rivalries occasionally flare up as genuine street warfare, usually settled in backroom deals and chalked up to anarchist strife.

IN ROMA2032...
The population of undocumented, stateless, rightless individuals (clandestini) has burgeoned to over 10 million people; consisting mainly of refugees, fugitives, and the scurf of other factions (Italians can now risk losing citizenship if they do not actively participate in consumerism, or worse, cannot maintain their debts). 

IN ROMA2032...
Due to the broadening of popular anti-Zingari legislation, anyone can now be declared a ‘Zingaro’ by the powers that be; once upon the word meant ‘gypsy’, but after relentless persecution thinning the numbers of this already scarce populace the term now more accurately means ‘public enemy’. Zingari are hounded mercilessly by all the factions of Italy, regardless of affiliation or context. The best an apprehended Zingaro can hope for is to ‘disappear’.

IN ROMA2032...
The island of Elba has been transformed into a prison colony, and exists as an anarchic, unadministered dumping ground for all manner of society’s unwanted scum. From refugees to criminals, clandestini to the luckiest of Zingeri- every ride to Elba is a one-way ticket. Paradoxically, life on Elba has perhaps the greatest equality and humanity in all of Italy.

IN ROMA2032...
Underground rebel groups of clandestini hacktivists inhabit the subterranean catacombs and sewers of old Rome. Beneath the noses of the factions above they work to subvert their stranglehold on on Italy in futility.

IN ROMA2032...
There exists no grassroots opposition to the dystopic power structure smothering Italy. Instead, a squabbling sea of idealist extremists flounder helplessly able only to gain ground against one another. Leftists, neo-fascists, anarchists, democrats, primitivist terrorists, have banded together into ideological street gangs whose adherents are chosen more by turf than philosophical preference.

IN ROMA2032...
Still no progress has been made on public works and infrastructure progjects. The city is encrusted with with successive layers of unfinished construction, semi-erected scaffolding, abandoned excavations, and tattered safety barriers. Every year the destitute government promises more similar such projects, and adds to the the scabs of deceit upon the face of the city with yet more empty preparations.

IN ROMA2032...
Private metanet cabling and antennae strangulate the ancient walls, windows, and rooftops. Neon lights and screens adorn the laneways, monuments, and churches, alongside crumbling marble statues and columns.
 
IN ROMA2032...
The Polizia, the Carabinieri, as well as a throng of private security corp rentacops patrol the beat; each frequently implement conflicting laws and regulations on shared zones (a revenue raising program in all-but-name).

IN ROMA2032...
The judiciary remains a separate faction in and of it’s own right, supposedly to uphold individual rights and mediate between the bickering factions. However it is a well known fact that the stain of corruption and conflict of interest runs deep in it’s foundations. Troublesome advocates and magistrates are quickly dismissed without the backing of one or more factions.
